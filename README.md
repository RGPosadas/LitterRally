## Development Guidelines

We try our best to adhere to the set of rules and guidelines that we've come up as a team to have an efficient workflow. To view our guidelines, refer to our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/RGPosadas/Mull/wiki).

## Setting Up your Development Environment

### Nx and npm

We use npm and Nx to manage our workspace and dependencies. The Nx CLI offers powerful tools for development, and we recommend you install it when contributing to the project.

1. Install npm and nodejs for your operating system.
1. Install the Nx CLI:
   - `npm install -g nx`
1. Install dependencies:
   - `npm i`

### Enforcing Code Formatting and Standards

This project uses pre-commit to enforce formatting and standards. To make sure standards are followed, Travis fails commits which don't comply. This section will detail how to setup pre-commit locally.

1. [Install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install):
   - `pip install pre-commit`
1. Install the git hooks needed for pre-commit for every commit:
   - `pre-commit install`
1. Run pre-commit on all files:
   - `pre-commit run -a`
1. You're done! pre-commit will now run when you create a commit for our repository!

### Secrets and configuration

Some secrets and sensitive configuration files are needed to properly operate certains parts of the stack.

1. Add an .env file with the required credentials in the root of the project (see `docs-and-resources` channel on slack for credentials):

   ```properties
   TYPEORM_HOST=<host>
   TYPEORM_USERNAME=<username>
   TYPEORM_PASSWORD=<password>
   ...
   ```

1. Start the server and client dev server in another terminal to test that everything is working correctly.
   - `nx serve mull-api`
   - `nx serve mull`

## Running Linting

Linting is done through the [Nx CLI](https://nx.dev/latest/react/cli/lint), and uses ESLint.

To lint a project:

```bash
nx lint <project>
```

To lint all projects:

```bash
nx run-many --target=lint --all
```

To lint projects affected by your changes:

```bash
nx affected:lint --base=origin/<base-branch>
```

## Running Tests

### Unit and UI Snapshot Tests

Testing is done thought the [Nx CLI](https://nx.dev/latest/react/cli/test), and uses Jest as the main test runner. Unit tests for our ui project(s) also include snapshot tests using [React Test Renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html).

To test a project:

```bash
nx test <project>
```

To update the snapshots of a project:

```bash
nx test <project> --updateSnapshot
```

To test all projects:

```bash
nx run-many --target=test --all
```

To test a specific file:

```bash
nx test <project> --test-file <file-name>
```

To test projects affected by your changes:

```bash
nx affected:test --base=origin/<base-branch>
```

### E2E Tests

E2E testing is done thought the [Nx CLI](https://nx.dev/latest/react/cli/e2e), and uses [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

To run e2e tests for a project:

```bash
nx e2e <project>
```

To run e2e tests in watch mode:

```bash
nx e2e <project> --watch
```

To run e2e tests in headless mode:

```bash
nx e2e <project> --headless
```

To run e2e tests on projects affected by your changes:

```bash
nx affected:e2e --base=origin/<base-branch>
```

## Running The Full Stack Application

Our project is a full stack application which need multiple parts to run properly. This section will detail how to run the project for different usecases.

### Serving the application locally for development

1. Serve the front-end application:
   - `npm start mull-ui`
1. Serve the back-end application (in a different tab):
   - `npm start mull-api`

### Running a local database for development

You can serve the database locally for testing, and to avoid interfering with the dev/prod databases.

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) (or any similar SQL clients)
1. Start docker
1. Pull a `mysql` image. This image contains the information needed to spin up an instance of a mysql database using docker
   - `docker pull mysql:5:7:32`
1. Create and run a MySQL container, which will run an instance of MySQL
   - `docker run --name mull-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:5.7.32`
1. Start MySQL Workbench and test the connection with your database on `localhost:3306`. If the test was successful, connect to it
1. Update the following fields in your `.env`:
   - `root=localhost`
   - `password=password`, or whatever password you put for `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`
1. Using MySQL Workbench, create a new schema in your database called `mull-dev` (case sensitive)

You now should have a functioning mysql database running locally, usable for the project!

To stop the container whilst keeping the database changes, run `docker stop mull-db`

### Working with GraphQL on the Frontend

1. Write your query/mutation into the respective `.gql` files located in `apps/mull-ui/src/graphql`
2. Run GraphQL Codegen:
   - `npm run gen-graphql`
3. Import hooks from `apps/mull-ui/src/generated/graphql.tsx`

### Building and Serving the application for production

1. Build the application for production:
   - `npm run build-ui && npm run build-api`
1. Serve the production frontend:
   1. Install `http-server` (or some other web server)
      - `npm i -g http-server`
   1. (Optional) Generate local SSL certificates for HTTPS
      - `openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem`
   1. Run a server locally:
      - `http-server dist/apps/mull-ui -p 8080 -c-1`
      - Add the `-S` option if using HTTPS
1. Serve the production backend:
   - `node dist/apps/mull-api/main.js`

### Populate database

You can populate the database with random values:

Prerequisite:

- Update the .env with what's on drive

seeding:

1. Start the database, if running locally
1. Run `npm run start mull-api` to update the columns (You don't have to have this running afte updating)
1. Run `npm run seed:run`

## Travis CI

### Scripts

Scripts used for running checks on Travis CI can be found under the `scripts/` folder.

- `ci-checks.sh`: This script is meant to be run by Travis CI. It checks the trigger of the current build and run the appropriate checks.
- `check-all.sh`: This script runs lint, test and e2e checks on all projects. To run it:
  1. `bash scripts/check-all.sh`
- `check-affected.sh`: This script runs lint, test and e2e checks on affected projects. To run it:
  1. `export BASE_BRANCH=develop`, or some other base branch
  1. `bash scripts/check-affected.sh`

## Troubleshooting

### Failing Travis Builds

We are now caching `npm` and `pre-commit` for faster build times. However, it is possible for the cache to be spoiled with bad data, or can simply become invalid/obsolete. This would result in inconsistent, or even failed, Travis builds compared to local builds.

As a fix, try [clearing the Travis cache](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/#clearing-caches). Once cleared, re-run the builds.

### Package lock merge conflicts

When there are merge conflicts in the `package-lock.json` file, here are the general steps to take to fix them:

1. Delete the `package-lock.json` file
2. Temporarily remove the `preinstall` script in `package.json`. Installing packages with that script without the lock file won't work.
3. Run `npm i` to install the packages again and regenerate the `package-lock.json` file.
4. Put back the `preinstall` script you removed in step 2
